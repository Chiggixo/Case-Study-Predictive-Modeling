# Case-Study-Predictive-Modeling
Objective:
Develop predictive models to forecast or classify outcomes.

Steps:
Dataset: Example - Housing prices (housing.csv) or any tabular dataset.
Tasks:
Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, scaling, encoding).
Split the data into training and test sets.
Train a Linear Regression model for prediction.
Evaluate using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
Tools:
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.
Example Problem:
Predict house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, and location.
